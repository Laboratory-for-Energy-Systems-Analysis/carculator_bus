Comment,Assumed lifetime of 24 years. It is up-scaled to a 200 kW Level-3 charger by scaling the charger component up based on a mass of 1â€™290 kg given by AAB's 200 kW bus charger.,"The total mass is from AAB's 450 kW pantograph charger (1340 kg x 3) plus the charging interface (500 kg). But the material composition is extrapolated from the Level-2 charger :cite:`ct-1056`.",
